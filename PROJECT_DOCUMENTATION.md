# Core Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your-service-role-key

```

## 📊 Database Schema Highlights

### **Fragment Table (Core Entity)**
```sql
fragment {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  user_id: UUID (foreign key)
  title: TEXT (max 80 chars)
  body: TEXT
  transcript: TEXT (from media)
  event_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
  location_text: TEXT
  lat/lng: DOUBLE PRECISION
  visibility: ENUM
  tags: TEXT[]
  system_emotions: TEXT[]
  system_themes: TEXT[]
  media: JSONB
  embedding: VECTOR(1536)
  status: TEXT (READY/PROCESSING/FAILED)
}
```

### **Link Table (AI Connections)**
```sql
link {
  from_id/to_id: UUID (fragment references)
  type: ENUM (SEMANTIC/SHARED_TAG/SAME_TIMEWINDOW/SAME_LOCATION)
  score: DOUBLE PRECISION
  reason: TEXT (explanation)
}
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### **Row Level Security Policies**
```sql
-- Fragments are only visible to owner or if public
CREATE POLICY own_read ON fragment FOR SELECT 
USING (visibility = 'PUBLIC' OR user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can only modify their own fragments
CREATE POLICY own_write ON fragment FOR UPDATE 
USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User enters email → Magic link sent
2. User clicks link → Redirected to `/auth/callback`
3. Session established → Access to protected routes
4. RLS policies enforce data access control
